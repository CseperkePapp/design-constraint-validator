# Examples

This page indexes the example projects under `examples/` and explains what each one demonstrates.

For full details, see the individual `README.md` files in each example directory.

---

## Minimal & Failing Examples

- `examples/minimal/`
  - Smallest possible token/constraint setup for DCV.
  - Good starting point to understand the JSON shapes and CLI flow.

- `examples/failing/`
  - Curated examples that intentionally fail constraints.
  - Demonstrates:
    - Monotonicity failures (typography, spacing, color ramps)
    - WCAG contrast violations
    - Threshold and touch-target issues
  - Useful for exploring error messages, `why`, and JSON output.

---

## Integration Examples

- `examples/style-dictionary/`
  - Shows how to integrate DCV with Style Dictionary.
  - Covers:
    - Using DCV to validate tokens generated by Style Dictionary.
    - Configuration patterns for mixed pipelines.
    - Example CI snippets.

- `examples/tokens-studio/`
  - Demonstrates validating Tokens Studio JSON exports.
  - Highlights:
    - How DCV’s adapters normalize Tokens Studio formats.
    - Recommended directory structure and config.

- `examples/dtcg/`
  - Examples based on the Design Tokens Community Group (DTCG) format.
  - Shows how DCV handles DTCG-compliant token sets.

---

## Advanced / Thematic Examples

- `examples/advanced-constraints/`
  - More complex cross-axis and policy-based constraints.
  - Good for exploring:
    - Multi-axis rules (size/weight/contrast)
    - Policies and stricter constraint sets
    - Graph and `why` outputs on richer datasets.

---

## How to Run Examples

From the repo root, you can run any example directly with the CLI. For example:

```bash
npx dcv validate ./examples/minimal/tokens.example.json

npx dcv validate ./examples/failing/contrast-fail.tokens.json

npx dcv validate ./examples/style-dictionary/output.tokens.json --policy ./themes/policies/aa.json
```

Refer to each example’s `README.md` for the exact commands and context.
